Plugin module

Abstract implementation of what a plugin look like

IMPORTANT: If you consider that some features are enough generic and can help other,
           be free to submit them in the Core as an helper to build plugins.

           Generic plugins are welcome in the Core too.

        - if you want to share some sessions across different instances, this is where you can init database, cache or whatever you want.
        - if you need a kind of root user to do some specific operations not available to a regular user,

        Open a session

        Session is an abstract concept that will be stored in a Core.Context. This is up to the plugin to define what should be a session.
        
        A session can be :
        - nothing (None) if you want to use a global user (see root user usage in init())
        - object that will identify a regular user (provided with args) to run as much as possible commands against your sccs with effective user credential
        - object like a library client instance on your specific sccs.
        - ...
        
        Advanced example:
        - check if a session is alreday open in a cache/database/... system initialized for this plugin
        - if the session exists, return it instead of opening a new one
        - if it doesn't exist, open a new one and store it in the cache/database/...

        Simple example:
        - just return args as the session. Args should include everything that will permit all other functions to query the sccs.

        Extra easy example with a "root user":
        - return None: we don't need anything as we will rely only on the root user / connection created in init() stage (for auditability and security you should not do that)
